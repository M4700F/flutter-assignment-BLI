# Comments Feature Implementation

## What's New

I've successfully implemented a **comments feature** for your Hacker News app that allows users to view comments for each story on a dedicated page.

## Features Added

### üÜï New Files Created:

1. **`/lib/data/models/comment_model.dart`**
   - Model class for comments with all necessary fields
   - Helper methods for formatting time and cleaning HTML text
   - Validation to filter out deleted/dead comments

2. **`/lib/presentation/screens/comments_screen.dart`**
   - Dedicated screen for displaying story comments
   - Shows story information at the top
   - Nested comment display with indentation
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Expandable comment threads (with depth limit)

3. **`/lib/presentation/providers/comments_provider.dart`**
   - State management for comments using Riverpod
   - Handles loading, error states, and comment data
   - Supports nested comment loading

### üîÑ Files Modified:

4. **API Service** (`api_service.dart`)
   - Added `getComment()` and `getComments()` methods
   - Fetch individual or multiple comments by ID

5. **Repository** (`hacker_news_repository.dart`)
   - Added comment fetching functionality
   - Limits initial comments to 50 to avoid UI overload
   - Separate method for nested comments

6. **Router** (`app_router.dart`)
   - Added routes for story details and comments
   - Supports navigation with story data

7. **Story Card** (`story_card.dart`)
   - Complete redesign with action buttons
   - Separate buttons for "Comments" and "Open URL"
   - Click story title to view details
   - Click comments button to view comments

8. **Story Detail Screen** (`story_detail_screen.dart`)
   - Added navigation to comments when clicking comment count
   - Shows notification if no comments available

## How It Works

### üì± User Flow:

1. **View Stories**: Browse through Top/Best/New stories
2. **Access Comments**: Click the "**X comments**" button on any story card
3. **Navigate**: App will redirect to a dedicated comments page
4. **Back Navigation**: Use the back button in the app bar to return to stories
5. **Explore**: View threaded comments with expandable reply threads
6. **Open Original**: Use the floating action button to open the story URL in browser
6. **Load Replies**: Click "X replies" to load nested comments

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation:

- **Navigation**: Uses GoRouter for clean URL-based navigation
- **State Management**: Riverpod for reactive state management
- **Caching**: Comments are fetched fresh each time (no caching yet)
- **Performance**: Limits to 50 top-level comments to avoid overwhelming UI
- **UI/UX**: Material 3 design with proper loading states
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with retry options

### üé® UI Features:

- **Story Header**: Shows story title, score, author, and time
- **Threaded Comments**: Visual indentation for nested comments  
- **Time Formatting**: Human-readable timestamps (2h ago, 3d ago)
- **HTML Cleaning**: Removes HTML tags from comment text
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading indicators
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages
- **Empty States**: Helpful message when no comments exist
- **Back Button**: Easy navigation back to story list
- **Floating Action Button**: Quick access to open original story URL

## Usage

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run -d linux`
2. **Browse stories**: Navigate through Top/Best/New stories
3. **View comments**: Click "X comments" button on any story
4. **Explore threads**: Expand comment threads to see replies

The comments feature is now fully integrated and ready to use! üéâ
